# About the Network Data Files

Extra information about the network data files and how they are currently formatted.

## Formatting

Files are saved as CSV files. They can have headings, although the actual names are ignored.

## Lizard Social Network

Sleepy Lizard population in Australia. Two lizards were assumed to had made a social contact if they were within 2 m of
each other at any of the synchronized
10 min GPS locations.

    - Abstract: "Although theoretical models consider social networks as pathways for disease transmission, strong
      empirical support, particularly for indirectly transmitted parasites, is lacking for many wildlife populations. We
      found multiple genetic strains of the enteric bacterium _Salmonella enterica_ within a population of Australian
      sleepy lizards (_Tiliqua rugosa_), and we found that pairs of lizards that shared bacterial genotypes were more
      strongly connected in the social network than were pairs of lizards that did not. In contrast, there was no
      significant association between spatial proximity of lizard pairs and shared bacterial genotypes. These results
      provide strong correlative evidence that these bacteria are transmitted from host to host around the social
      network, rather than that adjacent lizards are picking up the same bacterial genotype from some common source."
